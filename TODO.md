 TODO list:
 
 - Check calculations, and time calculations something is wrong
    - the x-axis aligned from the focus to the perihelion, so the planets are not "syncronized"
    - all the planets have different perihelion's so somehow translate the coordinates
 - Speed up<-->down button
 - Reverse time button
 - Replace ´pygame.draw.circle()´ with images and blitting them
 - Draw the orbits of the planets
 - Add background
 - Make an executable with pyinstaller /if possible/
